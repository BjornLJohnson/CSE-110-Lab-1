#### Prepare to learn some facts about me

I was born in *Mountain View*

I **really** want a dog (Please enjoy this picture of a dog I wish was mine)

I've ~~never~~ sometimes made mistakes in my code

**Okay maybe I make more than a _few_ mistakes**

***But that isn't important!***

A mantra I try to live by
> Hakuna Matata
> 
> -Pumba

I can write `code`

Sometimes I write
```
Lots of code
To do things
Very cool things
```
